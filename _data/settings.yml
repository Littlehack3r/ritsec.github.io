  We believe security is for anyone who wants to learn and center our activities around multiple aspects of security. This includes
  live individual and team-based competitions, hands-on training, student run research, and sponsor talks. Our security exercises
  cover a wide variety of areas in computing security, including penetration testing, Windows and Linux server hardening,
  web security, network services, and more!</p>
  <p>In 2018, the Security Practices And Research Student Association (SPARSA) and RIT Competitive Cybersecurity Club (RC3) merged to become RITSEC.
  As a result, the security community at RIT became more unified as the major and industry grew.</p>
