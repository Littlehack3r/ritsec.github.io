    Although we have very supportive sponsors, we welcome donations from the
    entire community. We have never, and will never ask for membership fees. Our
    members pay for the club with their passion and hard work. This passion is
    enough to keep the club running forever. However, funding allows us to apply
    our passion to really awesome projects and events. Your donations will go
    towards competitions, social events, conference scholarships, and other
    general club activities.
